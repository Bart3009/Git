# Workgroup_Git

This is my test file for Git(Hub).

This line is added on GitHub, while the previous added line was added on my pc.

This is written in the develop branch.

So the new feature_2 branch is amazing!

So this is new in the feature branch. (not the feature_2 branch)

This line is added in the master branch, while the featur_3 branch is active.

So this is my last change in the master before I understand what I'm doing.
